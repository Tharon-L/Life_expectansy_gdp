# Life_expectansy_gdp
I will analyze, prepare, and plot data about GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization in order to answer questions in a meaningful way. After I perform my analysis, I will create a blog post to share your findings on the World Health Organization website.

# Dataset
The dataset used is all_data.csv which contains:

 - Country

 - Year

 - Life expectancy at birth (years)

 - GDP (In billions)

# Countries included in the analysis:

 - Chile

 - China

 - Germany

 - Mexico

 - United States of America

 - Zimbabwe

# Project graphs and explanation:
1) LinePLot
 - Show life expectancy trends over time by country
 - Outcome : A general trend was identified, Life expectansy and GDP increases overtime.
2) ScatterPlot/Trendlines
 - Show the relationship between economic development and health outcomes
 - Outcome : We identified the food/political crisis of the begining of the milenial in Zimbabwe
3) Bar plot
 - Comparing life expanctancy of all the country
 - Outcome : Even if the U.S have more GDP, life expectancy is lower than In Chile and Germany, saying that GDP is not the only factor for life expectancy.
4) Pair plots
 - Showing the summary of all the previous analysis to conclude.

# Python libraries used
 - Seaborn and Matplotlib.pyplot for data vis.
 - Pandas for framing the data
 - Numpy for eventual further statistical analysis

# Personnal gains
 - New functions :
    ° plt.xscale('log') for big ranges like GDP
    ° plt.tight_layout() to fit all the labels in one shot in the graph

# Conclusion
This project allowed me to .....
Do noy hesitate to check my article on the WHO blog, I will put all the graphs there.
